This project allows you to explore using docker and docker-compose on the following VMs and cloud providers:

1. VirtualBox
2. Azure
3. Amazon

On Amazon, it is possible to use EC2 spot instances to save on the cost of cloud VMs.  Spot instances could save you more than 50% off the cost of on-demand instances.
